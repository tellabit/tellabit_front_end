               <h3>Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</h3>
               <p>We ask security researchers to keep vulnerabilities and communications around vulnerability submissions private and confidential until a patch is developed to protect the people using Tendermints protocols. In addition to this, we ask that you:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Allow us a reasonable amount of time to correct or address security vulnerabilities.</li>
                  <li>Avoid exploiting any vulnerabilities that you discover.</li>
                  <li>Demonstrate good faith by not disrupting or degrading Tendermints data or services.</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>Bug Bounty Program</h2>
               <p>At Tendermint, we strongly believe in compensating researchers for the time they invest in making cryptocurrencies stronger and more resilient. Depending on the severity and criticality of an issue, researchers who report bugs and respect our vulnerability disclosure policy may be eligible for rewards through our <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/bug-bounty-program-for-tendermint-cosmos-833c67693586">bug bounty program</a> with HackerOne.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Bounty reward amounts are based on many factors, including impact, risk, likelihood of exploitation, and report quality.</li>
                  <li>There is no maximum reward in the program, but critical bugs are eligible for rewards equivalent to $2,500 in ETH or more. For severe bugs or exceptional bug reports, we may decide to pay lower-tier bugs a higher-tier reward.</li>
                  <li>Program rewards will be paid in ETH, and will be calculated using prices at the time of payment.</li>
                  <li>If we receive duplicate bug reports, we will award a bounty to the first person who reported the issue.</li>
                  <li>Any bugs that are found in services that we use (i.e. Mailchimp, Meetup, RiotChat) are ineligible for rewards, and should be disclosed directly to those services.</li>
